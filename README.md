# Apple II Card Slot Riser

This is a simple KiCad project to build an Apple II card slot riser.

It contains mounting points for straddle-mounting an edge connector, or using a right-angle connector.

It also contains a spot to mount a 50 pin header for connection to a logic analyzer or something else like a slot extender.

Only the +5V power line is connected; +12, -12, and -5 are unconnected for safety. But adding them back would be trivial if you need them.
